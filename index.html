              Providing all the evidences of purchase by the cardholder and putting it in the required format and

              Proactive Network Maintenance (PNM) is revolutionary in the cable industry. Consequently it provides cable

              plant and in-home and or outside plant impairments on a user friendly interface easily understood by
              technicians using GIS technology. Proactive Network Maintenance is an application that uses DOCSIS
              pre-equalization to proactively identify hybrid fiber coax (HFC) RF plant impairments more efficiently and
              cost effectively rather than traditional test equipment.

            <p>
              The project is to migrate the data from legacy system to exsiting PLM database.
              The data from legacy system is available in MS Excel file format and the data loader adapters are used to
              read this file and load the data in PLM database.
              While loading the data, the unload data scripts are also generated so that failure cases can be handeled
              to reload the data.
              The temporary database is also used to store some data, which can be used for further processing after
              data load.
              The adapters connect to Oracle database to store the data.
              Data mining is performed after data loading. Data mining can be achieved using application customization.
              Data is loaded from 6 different legacy systems.

            <p>
              This is integration between MSOffice applications like MSWord, MSExcel with PLM software.
              Consists of two components, the server side componentis is developed in Java whereas the client side GUI
              component is developed in the MSOffice environment using C++
              The two components talk to each other using Applet using XML based protocol.
              This integration is used in various organizations where MSOffice tool are used.
              The office applications interact with applet on the client machine and applet interacts with servlet on
              server to transfer the data from client machine to the matrix software.
              Data on server is processed by server component and saved in PLM Oracle database.
            </p>
            <p>Technologies used are Servlet, Applet, XML, Java programs in PLM tool, Install anywhere, weblogic</p>

              Integration Exchange Framework is used by various eMatrix integrations like CAD integration.
              The CAD softwares like solidworks, solidedge, Catia saves its Meta data and file in PLM tools database
              using this integration.

              The exsisting XML protocols were modified to remove the user interface.
              The client component sends the xml packet to server and is porcessed on server.
              There is no user interface to make any kind of selection or any user intervention.

              Porting of latest version of integration exchange framework onto the older version of supporting
              platforms.
              The work involved in changing the JSP pages to refer the old jar files instead of the new. Also changing
              the applet and servlet code to refer the old jar. This was achieved by writing Unix scripts to change all
              the java and jsp files and also some include files.
              Because of the scripts the development time was reduced drastically and the team could get more time for
              unit testing and system testing.
              The project was delivered on time.
